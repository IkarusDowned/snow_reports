## Consolidated snowpack with no propagation observed: Jan 1 crust buried under 115cm of storm snow, CTEN at 125cm

Significant consolidation observed since January 5 assessment. The reactive melt-freeze crust identified on Jan 5 (CTH1 SP @ 85cm) is now buried under 115cm of consolidated storm snow and showed no propagation in column testing (CTEN after 30 taps). Rain event and warming to approximately 1650m on January 17 contributed to consolidation of the snowpack below this elevation. At 1825m, the pit location remained above the rain line and received snow throughout the storm cycle.

## QUICK SUMMARY - CTEN @ 125cm on K crust, 115cm consolidated storm snow above

On the morning of Jan 19, we conducted a snowpack assessment at 1825m on E-NE open terrain on Mt. Mae. Column test showed no failure after full tap sequence (30 taps) on the same ice crust identified in the January 5 assessment. The crust is now buried at 125cm depth under consolidated storm snow. Total snow height 210cm (pit depth 150cm). No signs of instability observed.

## AVALANCHE SUMMARY - NO ACTIVITY OBSERVED

No avalanche activity observed. No signs of instability (whumpfing, cracking) noted during approach or fieldwork. Tour to summit of Mt. Mae with conservative route selection avoiding terrain traps and dense brush areas.

Spatial assessment suggests the consolidation may be elevation and aspect dependent, with the rain line at approximately 1650m on January 17 potentially creating different stability conditions at lower elevations.

## SNOWPACK SUMMARY - HS 210cm, CTEN @ 125cm K crust, 2F-1F consolidated storm snow above, 1F RG below

**Total Snow Height:** 210cm  
**Pit Depth:** 150cm

**Structure:** The melt-freeze crust from January 5 assessment now buried at 125cm depth (85cm from ground). Approximately 115cm of consolidated storm snow above the crust. Crust showed no propagation tendency in column testing.

**Hardness Profile:**
- Surface (0-10cm): Light density settled snow, sun crust below surface
- 10-125cm: Consolidated storm snow, progressive hardening 2F → 1F → approaching K at crust
- 125cm: Ice crust, Knife hardness (K) - same layer from Jan 5 assessment
- 125-150cm: 25cm of rounded grains, 1F hardness
- 150-210cm: Not observed (below pit depth)

**Grain Types and Bonding:**
- Surface layer: Recent light snow with solar-affected surface
- Storm snow: Well-consolidated storm snow showing good bonding throughout
- At crust: Same melt-freeze crust from Jan 5, now showing improved integration with surrounding layers
- Below crust: Rounded grains with good bonding

**Temperature Profile:**
- Air temperature during assessment: -4°C
- Snowpack temperature: Less than 1°C differential throughout entire snowpack over 150cm pit depth
- Temperature at rounds below K crust: -0.4°C
- Snowpack near isothermal conditions

**Stability Tests:**  
- **CT:** End column, no result (CTEN). Completed full tap sequence (10 Easy + 10 Medium + 10 Hard = 30 taps total) with no failure observed. Column manually removed at K crust layer after test completion.

**Comparison to January 5 Assessment:**  
January 5 tests at 1360m showed sudden planar failure (CTH1 SP) at 85cm depth on this same melt-freeze crust. Current assessment at 1825m shows no propagation (CTEN) with the crust now at 125cm depth. The significant change suggests:
- Additional 115cm of storm snow has loaded and consolidated above the crust
- Rain event and warming to approximately 1650m on Jan 17 (snow at this elevation) contributed to consolidation
- 40cm of additional burial depth plus improved bonding above and below the crust
- Interface that was reactive on Jan 5 is now showing stable behavior at this location and elevation

**Layers identified:**  
- Surface to 10cm: Light settled snow, sun crust below surface
- 10-125cm: Consolidated storm snow (115cm), progressive hardness increase
- 125cm: Knife-hard ice crust - same layer from Jan 5, now integrated
- 125-150cm: 25cm rounded grains, good bonding
- Below 150cm: Not assessed

## WEATHER SUMMARY - Recent: ~150cm new snow since Jan 5, rain to ~1650m Jan 17; Current: Overcast, -4°C, calm winds in pit

Significant storm cycle since January 5 delivered approximately 150cm of new snow (settled to ~115cm of consolidated snowpack). Warming event on January 17 brought rain to approximately 1650m elevation. At pit location (1825m), precipitation remained as snow throughout the storm cycle.

**Conditions during fieldwork:**
- Sky: Overcast
- Temperature: -4°C
- Wind: Calm in pit location, gusty at ridgeline
- Precipitation: None during observation

## TRAVEL CONDITIONS - Good conditions above 1750m, wind-affected on easterly aspects, avoided terrain traps and dense brush

Skiing conditions good above 1750m elevation. Easterly facing slopes showed wind affect at higher elevations. Toured to summit of Mt. Mae with conservative route selection, avoiding terrain traps and areas with dense brush.

## ASSESSMENT - Jan 5 reactive layer (CTH1 SP) now stable (CTEN), buried under 115cm consolidated storm snow, rain and warming to ~1650m on Jan 17 contributed to consolidation

The buried ice crust that showed reactive behavior on January 5 (CTH1 SP at 1360m elevation) now shows stable behavior at this higher elevation location (1825m). The crust has been buried under approximately 115cm of consolidated storm snow and showed no propagation in column testing despite full tap sequence.

The January 17 rain event and related warming to approximately 1650m elevation likely contributed to consolidation of the snowpack. At 1825m, the pit location remained above the rain line and received snow, resulting in a well-consolidated storm snow slab above the previously reactive crust layer.

Key changes since January 5:
- Crust burial: 85cm → 125cm depth (40cm additional)
- Test results: CTH1 SP → CTEN (reactive to stable)
- Load above crust: 40cm → 115cm of consolidated storm snow
- Bonding: Weak bonding with rounded grains → well-consolidated throughout

The spatial and elevation-dependent nature of these observations suggests conditions may vary across the Myoko area. The rain line at approximately 1650m on January 17 may have created different consolidation patterns at various elevations. Additional observations from other aspects and elevations continue to be valuable for understanding current snowpack behavior.
