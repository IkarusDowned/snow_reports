# MYOKO SNOWPACK OBSERVATIONS REPORT

**Date:** Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 12:27 PM  
**Location:** Myoko - Mt. Akakura - N-NE open slope  
**Coordinates:** 36.88130, 138.12997  
**Elevation:** 1821m (5974 ft)  
**Aspect:** N-NE (heading 045)  
**Activity:** Snowpack assessment  
**Observers:** Nik N

## Concerning results observed: No significant CT reactivity at pit site; wind-affected snow near summit and below-average coverage remained key operational concerns

No significant stability result was produced in compression testing at this location. Operational concerns during travel were terrain-related more than avalanche-related: wind-affected snow at higher elevations and persistent brush/ground hazards linked to below-average coverage.

## QUICK SUMMARY - CT no-result/no concerning reaction at 120cm interface in 135cm pit, HS 245cm, no instability signs observed

At 12:27 PM on Feb 1, we completed a snowpack assessment on Mt. Akakura at 1821m on N-NE terrain. Compression testing was inconclusive/no-result, with no movement or concerning reaction. HS was 245cm; pit depth was 135cm. A notable interface was observed at 120cm depth (about 2cm thick) but did not produce a reactive result in testing.

## AVALANCHE SUMMARY - NO ACTIVITY OBSERVED

No avalanche activity observed. No whumpfing, cracking, or other direct signs of instability were reported during travel or at the pit.

## SNOWPACK SUMMARY - HS 245cm, pit 135cm, interface at 120cm (~2cm) with slight sugary texture and early rounding, CT no-result

**Total Snow Height (HS):** 245cm  
**Pit Depth:** 135cm

**Hardness Profile (top to bottom):**
- 0-40cm: F
- 40-50cm: 3F (field estimate between standard 4F and 1F)
- 50-70cm: 2F
- 70-80cm: 1F
- 80-135cm: P

**Interface:**
- At ~120cm down from surface
- Approximate thickness ~2cm
- Slightly sugary texture, starting to bond and round
- Crystals approximately 1mm
- Above and below interface: bonded, rounded ~1mm crystals with good cohesion
- Did not produce a notable compression-test response

**Stability Test:**
- **CT:** No result / inconclusive, no movement of concern

**Temperature Profile:**
- Surface (air/surface reference): -7°C
- 135cm depth: -3°C
- Interface temperature (~120cm): -4°C
- Above interface: -3.8°C
- Below interface: -3.6°C
- Approximate gradient: warming with depth at ~0.3°C per 10cm

## WEATHER SUMMARY - Recent HST 100cm since Jan 29 storm cycle, cold overnight, light snowfall (S-1) during observation

Recent weather included a storm cycle beginning Jan 29 and ending Jan 31, with **HST 100cm** reported for that period. No rain was reported in this cycle. Overnight conditions were cold with clear skies and negative temperatures. A new storm cycle began the morning of Feb 1.

**Conditions during fieldwork:**
- Sky: Overcast
- Precipitation: Light snow, less than S1 (S-1)
- Air temperature: -7°C
- Wind: Negligible at pit location
- Visibility: Good
- HN24: Not observed

## TRAVEL CONDITIONS - Good skiing, wind effect near summit, brush hazards remained primary travel limitations

Skiing quality was generally good. At higher elevations near the summit, snow was wind-affected with evidence of cross-loading. Brush and terrain hazards remained significant because of below-average snowpack coverage. Route selection prioritized bush/terrain hazard management more than avalanche hazard avoidance.

---

## ASSESSMENT - Local pit showed limited reactivity despite identifiable interface; travel risk remained weighted toward terrain hazards with localized wind effects at higher elevation

This observation point showed a structured, relatively strong upper-to-mid pack over a deeper dense base, with a notable but currently non-reactive interface at 120cm. Interface snow was slightly sugary but showed early bonding/rounding (about 1mm), and layers above and below were bonded rounded 1mm grains with good cohesion. Compression testing did not identify immediate triggering concerns at the pit site. With no observed avalanche activity and no direct signs of instability, immediate concern at this location appeared lower than in previous reactive periods.

Spatial variability remains important: wind-affected higher-elevation terrain and cross-loading near summit features may still produce localized instability not captured by a single pit result. Operationally, terrain and snow-cover limitations (brush/ground hazards) were the dominant travel constraints.
